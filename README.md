# SCPI base project
 Base from which SCPI projects can be made. Designed for use with Teensy microcontrollers using the PlatformIO framework in VScode. Just copy/fork/clone this project and begin!

 Sample SCPI commands still exist in the lib/common/scpi-def.cpp file, as per the source. Modify the SCPI command list in there to add/remove commands as needed. Hardware IO should be handled as part of the main source.
